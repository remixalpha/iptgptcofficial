          Nestled within a luscious green forest cover stretching over
          kilometres, Institute of Printing Technology and Government
          Polytechnic College was established in 1967 by the Govt. of Kerala
          under the department of Technical Education and is approved by AICTE
          (Permanent ID: 1-474656361) and affiliated to SBTE (Affiliation No.
          SBTE101901). What started as an Institute of Printing Technology,
          developed and evolved to be one of the major centres of excellence in
          Technical Education with the incorporation of the Department of
          Electronics Engineering in 1987 and the Department of Computer
          Engineering in 1989. It has the privilege of being the only Institute
          in the entire state which offers a three-year Diploma Programme in
          Printing Technology.
